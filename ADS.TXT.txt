#To create an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) on a file located on your desktop using the Windows Command Prompt, follow these instructions:
#Open a Command Prompt window:

#Press Win + R, type "cmd," and press Enter.
#Alternatively, you can search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu and open it.

#Navigate to your desktop directory:

cd %userprofile%\Desktop

#To create a text file named "readme.txt" with the content "I am a harmless file," use the following command:

echo I am a harmless file > readme.txt

#To create an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) with secret content, use the following command:

echo this is my list of secret evil stuff > readme.txt:secret.txt

#This command will create an alternate data stream named "secret.txt" inside the "readme.txt" file on your desktop with the specified content.
#To confirm that the original file "readme.txt" still contains its original content, open it with Notepad:

notepad readme.txt

#To access the secret message within the alternate data stream, open the file with the ADS name:

notepad readme.txt:secret.txt

#This will open the "secret.txt" alternate data stream and display the message "this is my list of secret evil stuff."

#Again, please use this technique responsibly and in accordance with the law, and be aware that some security software or configurations might detect and block the use of alternate data streams.

#For educational or private use (within the bounds of any and all local, state, federal, and international laws.
